* Introduction
A bash script to create a minimum C++ application written in [[http://wxwidgets.org][wxWidgets]] in current working directory.

The C++ application implemented a frame window and some common menu items.

It uses [[http://www.cmake.org][CMake]] to create project files. So it supports all the modern IDEs and GNU Make.

* Key points
- Work out of the box on Windows XP, OS X 10.7.3, Arch Linux
- The bundle thing on OS X is properly done.
